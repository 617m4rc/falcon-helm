You should be a Crowdstrike customer and have access to the Falcon Linux Sensor
and Falcon Container Downloads to install this helm chart and have it work
correctly as a specialized container has to exist in the container registry
before this chart will install properly.

The CrowdStrike Falcon sensor should be spinning up on all your kubernetes nodes
now. There should be no further action on your part unless no Falcon Sensor
container exists in your registry. If you forgot to add a Falcon Sensor image to
your image registry before you ran `helm install`, please add the Falcon Sensor
now; otherwise, pods will fail with errors and crash until there is a valid
image to pull. The default image name to deploy a kernel sensor to a node is
`falcon-node-sensor`.
