The CrowdStrike Falcon sensor should be spinning up on all your kubernetes nodes
now. There should be no further action on your part unless no Falcon Sensor
container exists in your regisry. If you forgot to add a Falcon Sensor image to
your image registry before you ran `helm install`, please add the Falcon Sensor
now; otherwise, your deployment will fail until there is a valid image to pull.
